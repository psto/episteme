# Economics

> "All models are wrong, but some are useful".

### Thoughts

* Most economics is speculation without stakes.
* Observe the underlying incentives.
  * Who profits the most?
  * Who suffers the most consequences directly from one’s actions?
  * How to \(re\)align the incentive structures?
* There is always an opportunity cost \(even if good things happen\). Always ask:
  * "What is the trade-off?"
  * "Under what conditions would my idea be a bad idea?"
* Politicians/bureaucrats are incentives to practice first-order thinking \(anticipating the immediate results of their actions/policy\). It's what gets them re-elected.
  * By "solving" one problem that way they create a bigger one down the road. They compound problems.
  * Solution: solve for the long term. Practice second-order and n-th order thinking.
    * "What are the consequences in 10 hours? 10 months? 10 Years? 100 years?"
* The demand curve slopes downward: if something becomes more expensive you do less of it.
* Markets work when both parties benefit from a trade.
* Understanding the price system tell us what ends up where doing what.
* The more growth you have, the bigger your margin of error. When in doubt optimize for growth.
  * "What actions can I take now that will produce compounding returns?"
  * "Am I on a track where my knowledge compounds?"
* Leave small crises to resolve themselves. Step in for huge ones.
* Debt is easy, but it's not the answer. Bureaucrats love it: no one gets fired for adding more debt.
  * Private debt shouldn't become public debt. Taxpayers shouldn't pay for bailouts.
* Crony capitalism is rent-seeking as a service. Warning signs:
  * Wealth is seen as a zero-sum game.
  * Wanting economic gain without any real risk.
  * High positions are equated with wealth, prestige and status.
  * Competition is seen as inconvenient and battled with special permits, grants, tax breaks.
* Decentralised systems withstand more than centralised systems.
