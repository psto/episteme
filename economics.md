# Economics

>  "All models are wrong, but some are useful". 

### Notes
* Most economics is speculation without stakes.
* Observe the underlying incentives.
  * Who profits the most?
  * Who suffers the most consequences directly from one’s actions?
  * How to (re)align the incentive structures?
* Leave small crises to resolve themselves. Step in for huge ones.
* Debt is not the answer. It compounds bureaucrats problems.
  * Private debt shouldn't become public debt. Taxpayers shouldn't pay for bailouts.
* Decentralised systems withstand more than centralised systems.
