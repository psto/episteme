> "Meditation is one of the greatest arts in life (...) and one cannot possibly learn it from anybody, that is the beauty of it." Jiddu Krishnamurti

### Thoughts
* We are always in problem-solving mode. Even when we think we are in the present, we are looking for what'll happen next.
  * Thinking is useful but constantly losing oneself in thought is a nightmare.
* Meditation is the practice of running your brain in "debug mode". 
  * Create space between your thoughts by being aware of them.
* One can't fail at meditation.
* The practice isn't about staying in focus but coming back into focus.
  * coming back to paying attention to the breath
  * building up an "attention muscle".
* It's better to ask "how am I relating to what’s happening?" than "what is happening?".
  * How we think about our experience changes the experience.
* Be kind to yourself. Don't judge.
* It's not about sitting. Walk around and practice accepting the moment you are in without making judgements.
