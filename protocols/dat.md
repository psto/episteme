### Making the web more user-centred.

[Dat](https://datproject.org/) is a p2p hypermedia protocol for sharing data between computers. It has public-key-addressed file archives which can be synced securely and browsed on-demand. Data is hosted and distributed by many computers on the network and can work offline or with poor connectivity. The original uploader can add or modify data while keeping a full history.

#### Goals
* public & private places for communities, without selling data to advertisers.
* more user control. 
* share directly and establish new models for digital collaboration.
