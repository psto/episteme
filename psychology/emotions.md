# Emotions

### Notes

* Brains are not pre-wired with neurons dedicated to a specific emotion.
* Lisa Feldman Barrett and her [theory of constructed emotion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_constructed_emotion):
  * "your brain makes an emotion by using prior experiences of emotion to predict and explain incoming sensory inputs, and guide action."
  * Key insight to the science of emotions: "**emotions are constructions of the world, not reactions to it**."
