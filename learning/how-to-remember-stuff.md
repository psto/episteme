# How to remember stuff?

Two words: [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition).

I use [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/), sync it with [AnkiWeb](https://ankiweb.net/) to my [phone](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ichi2.anki). As with most things the key is to make it a daily habit. I use morning coffee as a cue and reward.
