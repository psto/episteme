# Podcasts

I don't watch TV or read the news, but I do listen to podcasts. They are still underrated. Ideas seem to flourish more in a long form medium with a conversational tone. Also, I love how authors are forced to distil their needlessly-long-books.

I am subscribed to a lot of podcasts but I only listen to topics that sound interesting to me.

**Tip**: listen to podcasts at 3x speed (you can get used to it, start at 1.5x speed and work your way up).

I use [player.fm](https://player.fm).
