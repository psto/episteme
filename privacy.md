# Privacy

Modern web is a [Panopticon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panopticon)'s guard wet dream. We are being tracked by both private and state organizations. Data is the new gold rush and "[Surveillance Capitalism](https://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/debatten/the-digital-debate/shoshan-zuboff-on-big-data-as-surveillance-capitalism-13152525.html)" is [the biggest game](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2594754) in town.

But "[I have nothing to hide!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_to_hide_argument)"

> ["Arguing that you don't care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don't care about free speech because you have nothing to say."](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/36ru89/just_days_left_to_kill_mass_surveillance_under/crglgh2/) - Edward Snowden
