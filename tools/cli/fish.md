# fish

[fish](https://fishshell.com/) is a smart and user-friendly command line shell. [Try it in the browser](https://rootnroll.com/d/fish-shell/).

I use [fisher](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher) to manage packages, because it [uses a clean package structure](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher/issues/481).

### Some packages I use:

* [spacefish](https://github.com/matchai/spacefish) - a minimalistic, powerful and extremely customizable Fish Shell prompt.
* [z](https://github.com/jethrokuan/z) enables you to jump to the directory in mind.
* [Bass](https://github.com/edc/bass) - use utilities written for Bash in fish shell.
* [Fzf](https://github.com/jethrokuan/fzf) integrate fzf functionality into fish.
* [pisces](https://github.com/laughedelic/pisces) helps you to work with paired symbols in the command line.
