# fish

[fish](https://fishshell.com/) is a smart and user-friendly command line shell. [Try it in the browser](https://rootnroll.com/d/fish-shell/).

I use [fisher](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher) to manage packages, because it [uses a clean package structure](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher/issues/481).

### Some packages I use:

* [spacefish](https://github.com/matchai/spacefish) - a minimalistic, powerful and extremely customizable Fish Shell prompt.
* [z](https://github.com/jethrokuan/z) enables you to jump to the directory in mind.
* [Bass](https://github.com/edc/bass) - use utilities written for Bash in fish shell.
* [Fzf](https://github.com/jethrokuan/fzf) integrate fzf functionality into fish.
* [pisces](https://github.com/laughedelic/pisces) helps you to work with paired symbols in the command line.
* [jorgebucaran/nvm.fish](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/nvm.fish) Node.js version manager.
* [danhper/fish-ssh-agent](https://github.com/danhper/fish-ssh-agent) start your ssh agent.
* [decors/fish-colored-man](https://github.com/decors/fish-colored-man) color-enabled man pages.
