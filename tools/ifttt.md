# IFTTT

Some [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com) applets I use:

* Simply label a Gmail "Evernote" to send it there.
* If new post saved by me on Reddit, then save it as a note in Evernote.
* Append Instapaper Highlights to Evernote.
* When you create a new Trello card add an event to Google Calendar.
* If a new event in the calendar contains "todo" create a card in "ToDo" trello board.
* Move a document into Dropbox "kindle" folder and send it to kindle.
* Save all of YouTube liked videos in a spreadsheet.
* Save my tweets in a spreadsheet.
* Archive tweets you like to a Google spreadsheet.
