# Text Editor

[Vim](https://www.vim.org/) is my favourite text editor \(I use [neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim)\). It has changed completely how I interact with text. Any editor that forces you to use a mouse is wasting your time.

Think of using Vim commands as composing sentences. Take a "verb"' `d` \(delete\) + a "subject" `w` \(word\) and a whole word is deleted. It's easier than pressing `ctrl + shift + right arrow + delete` in a normal editor.

Vim spoiled me to the point that I use vim-like movement to browse the web \([vimium](https://github.com/philc/vimium)\).

My [.vimrc](https://github.com/psto/dotfiles/blob/master/init.vim) file and my [Vim plugins](vim-plugins.md).

## Other editors I use

* [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/) - a community-driven, freely-licensed binary distribution of Microsoftâ€™s editor VSCode. Second best choice for me after neovim.
