# Text Editor

[Vim](https://www.vim.org/) is my favourite text editor \(I use [neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim)\). It has changed completely how I interact with text. Any editor that forces you to use a mouse is wasting your time.

Think of using Vim commands as composing sentences. Take a "verb"' `d` \(delete\) + a "subject" `w` \(word\) and a whole word is deleted. It's easier than pressing `ctrl + shift + right arrow + delete` in a normal editor.

Vim spoiled me to the point that I use vim-like movement to browse the web \([vimium](https://github.com/philc/vimium)\).

My [.vimrc](https://github.com/psto/dotfiles/blob/master/init.vim) file.

## Other editors I use

* [Oni](https://www.onivim.io/) - built on neovim, combining modal editing with features of modern editors.
* [Atom](https://atom.io/) - a hackable text editor built on Electron.
* [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) - just because old habits die hard.
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - if I had to choose something other than neovim.
